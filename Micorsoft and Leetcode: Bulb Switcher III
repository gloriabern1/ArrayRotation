//Explanation

I just sumed the index of all the turned on bulbs, and compared them to the sum of the turned on bulbs. If they are equal then they are all blue.

var numTimesAllBlue = function(light) {

let SumIndex = 0;
const Arraylength = light.length;
let count=0;
for (var i = 0; i < Arraylength; i++) {
SumIndex += light[i];
let TurnedonBulbscount= i+1;
let sumturnedonbulbs= (TurnedonBulbscount*(TurnedonBulbscount+1))/2;
if(SumIndex===sumturnedonbulbs) {
count++;
}
}
return count;

};
