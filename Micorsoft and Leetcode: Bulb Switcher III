//Explanation

I just sumed the index of all the turned on bulbs, and compared them to the sum of the turned on bulbs. If they are equal then they are all blue.

var numTimesAllBlue = function(light) {

let SumIndex = 0;
const Arraylength = light.length;
let count=0;
for (var i = 0; i < Arraylength; i++) {
//summing the values of turned on bulbs
SumIndex += light[i];
//getting th count of turned on bulbs using the index
let TurnedonBulbscount= i+1;
//Getting the correct sum of turned on bulbs using the index (n*(n+1))/2
let sumturnedonbulbs= (TurnedonBulbscount*(TurnedonBulbscount+1))/2;
//comparing the sum of the values of turned on bulbs to the sum of tuned on bulbs count
if(SumIndex===sumturnedonbulbs) {
count++;
}
}
return count;

};
