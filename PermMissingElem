Write a function:

    function solution(A);

that, given an array A, returns the value of the missing element.

For example, given array A such that:
  A[0] = 2
  A[1] = 3
  A[2] = 1
  A[3] = 5

the function should return 4, as it is the missing element.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

        N is an integer within the range [0..100,000];
        the elements of A are all distinct;
        each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..(N + 1)].




solution
function solution(myarray){
  var arrlen= myarray.length +2;
  for(var i=1; i<arrlen ; i++){
   
      if(!myarray.includes(i)){
return i;
      }
  }
 
}
